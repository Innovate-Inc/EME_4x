<H1>EPA Metadata Editor (EME)</H1>
<H2>Customizing the EPA Metadata Editor Database</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EME utilizes a Microsoft Access database to supply default 
  information within the user interface. Information stored in this database can 
  be modified by the user to include new data or to change defaults that are 
  used by the 'Set Default' buttons. Making these changes requires that the 
  user have Microsoft Access installed locally on their machine. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Database Structure</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The database is structured to align closely with the flow of the 
  user interface. As such, all tables are named according to the location in 
  which their information resides in the EME user interface. All tables that 
  have information located on tab 1 of the user interface begin with a 1. All 
  tables that store information located on tab 2 of the user interface begin 
  with a 2. All tables that store information located on tab 3 of the database 
  begin with a 3. The tables are also ordered sequentially by letter. As such, 
  when sorted by name, the tables generally flow with the order of the elements 
  as they are located in the user interface, starting with the top 
  left.<BR><BR>Each table has a column in it called 'default'. This column 
  controls what is selected in the EME when the user clicks on the 'Set Default' 
  or 'D' buttons. Users may change the defaults used by the EME by selecting the 
  checkbox next to the entry of their choice. Note that you will need to uncheck 
  the currently selected default when selecting a new default. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Editing the Database</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To modify the EME database, take the following steps: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Navigate to Tools --> Open Database.
    <LI>Locate and open a table of interest (e.g., "1b_Publisher").
    <LI>Change the default by selecting a new default entry and deselecting the 
    existing default entry.
    <LI>Add new information by adding a new row to the table and entering your 
    own data.
    <LI>If you don't want anything to be selected as default for a particular 
    field, deselect all checkboxes in the user interface. 
    <LI>Close the database.
    <LI>Click on the 'Refresh DB' button to update the user interface. You will 
    need to click this button for each tab where changes should be 
    reflected.<BR><BR><IMG src="screenshot_refreshDB.jpg"><BR></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Special Database Edits</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are some edits that require changes to be made in the 
    'EME' table. These include the theme keyword thesaurus and the compound 
    element behavior settings. Any time a change is made in the EME table, 
    ArcCatalog must be closed and reopened for the new settings to take effect. 
    <BR><BR><B>Specifying Spell-check Behavior</B><BR>The EME table contains a 
    column for specifying which fields are searched when a user spell-checks a 
    metadata record. This field is called spell-check. This field can be enabled 
    (checked) or disabled (unchecked) for each element in the EME user 
    interface. Fields that have the spell-check field checked (enabled) will be 
    included when the spell check feature is used from the EME user interface. 

    <BR><BR><IMG src="screenshot_spellcheck2.jpg"><BR><BR><BR><B>Setting Compound Element Update Behavior 
    (Cluster Update Behavior)</B><BR>Compound element update behavior affects 
    the way the EME updates compound elements in a metadata record. Compound 
    elements are elements that contain other elements. For example, the contact 
    information element is a compound element that is comprised of fields such 
    as contact person, contact address, etc. The EME user interface does not 
    expose the entire set of elements contained in the FGDC content standard. As 
    such, there are some cases where only portions of a compound element are 
    available for a user to edit them. Users may choose to specify whether or 
    not the EME replaces an entire compound element when saving information to 
    the record or to only save the individual elements within the compound 
    element that were updated. The EME table allows the user to specify settings 
    for each compound element individually. By default, all elements are set to 
    replace the entire compound element. It is recommended that users retain 
    this default setting unless there is a good reason to change it for 
    particular fields. <BR><BR>This is set using the clusterUpdate field in the 
    EME table. If you would like to replace the entire content of a compound 
    element, select the clusterUpdate checkbox for that element. If you would 
    like to only update individual elements within a compound element, deselect 
    the clusterUpdate checkbox for that element. If an entire compound element 
    is replaced by the EME, all individual components of that element are 
    replaced. If the individual elements of a compound element are replaced 
    instead of the entire compound element, then some elements may not be 
    overwritten within a compound element. After this is done, you will need to 
    close and re-open ArcCatalog for the changes to take effect. <BR><BR>One 
    example of this is the contact information compound element. The EME allows 
    the user to specify information for many fields of the contact information 
    element, but there are some fields, such as hours of service, where this 
    information is not available in the EME. In those cases, if the user 
    deselects the clusterUpdate checkbox, the individual element (in this 
    example hours of service) will remain stored in the compound element along 
    with the new contact information. If the user has selected the clusterUpdate 
    checkbox, then the hours of service would be removed and replaced by the new 
    contact information.<BR><BR><IMG src="screenshot_cluster.jpg"><BR><BR><BR><B>Specifying a Theme 
    Keyword Thesaurus for User-defined Keywords</B><BR>The theme keyword 
    thesaurus information is stored in the EME table. To change this setting, 
    you will need to modify the tag called 
    "idinfo/keywords/theme[themekt='User']/themekt". Change the term 'User' to 
    the desired term to be used for the keyword thesaurus (e.g., 'My Personal 
    Thesaurus'). After this is done, you will need to close and re-open 
    ArcCatalog for the changes to take effect.<BR><BR><IMG 
    src="screenshot_themekey.jpg"><BR><BR><BR><B>Configuring the EME to Point to a New Database 
    Location</B><BR>
    Users can choose to point to a database that is stored in a 
    different location than the default location provided by the EME. This allows the EME 
    database to be shared by multiple users if desired. By default, the EME 
    database is placed into the install directory on the user's machine, in a sub-directory called template (usually "C:\Program Files\Innovate! Inc\EPA Metadata Editor\template"). The EME also creates an editable copy of the EME in each user's user directory (e.g., "C:\Users\jzichichi\AppData\Roaming\Innovate! Inc\EPA Metadata Editor"). EME makes this copy so that the operational database is not write-protected.  
	<br><br>The EME database location is specified in a setting stored in the config.xml 
    file associated with the EME. This file is located in the install directory 
    on your machine (usually "C:\Program Files\Innovate! Inc\EPA Metadata Editor\template). 
	When EME starts, it looks for the database in the following locations:<ul>
	<li>Check and use if the mdb exists where eme config file says (if one specified)
	<li>Check and use if the mdb exists in users own area
	<li>Otherwise make a copy of the one under template into the user's own area.
	</ul>
	You can copy and paste the EME database to a new location and point to this new location in the EME's config.xml file.  To specify the new location where the EME is stored, change the 
    entry called "MdbFilepathname" to your new location. You must include the 
    full path to the database, including the database name in the entry (e.g., 
    C:\temp\metadata.mdb). Make sure to close and re-open ArcCatalog once you 
    have made the change.
	 <BR><BR>It is recommended to leave a back-up of the original 
    database in the original installation directory so that the EME has a 
    failover database to access if the new location is unavailable. <BR><BR>
