<blockquote>Short Name: logic</blockquote>

<h3>FGDC Definition</h3>
<blockquote>An explanation of the fidelity of relationships in the data set and tests used.
</blockquote>
<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This element is required as per minimum FGDC requirements.  It is used to provide an overview of the types of tests that were performed to determine data integrity (consistency of features in the data set, as opposed to attributes or overall positional accuracy). <br><br>Types of tests are listed below (extracted from SDTS). For more information, please visit <a href='http://www.fgdc.gov/csdgmgraphical/dataq/logconfq.htm' target='_blank'>http://www.fgdc.gov/csdgmgraphical/dataq/logconfq.htm</a>
<br><ul>

<li><b>Tests of Valid Values</b> <ol>
<li>Tests for permissible values may be applied to any data structure. 
<li>Such a test can detect gross blunders, but it does not ensure all aspects of logical consistency.</li></ol>
<br>
<li><b>General Tests for Graphic Data</b><ol>
<li>A database containing lines may be subjected to the following general questions: <ol>
<li>Do lines intersect only where intended? 
<li>Are any lines entered twice? 
<li>Are all areas completely described? 
<li>Are there any overshoots or undershoots? 
<li>Are any polygons too small, or any lines too close? </ol>
<li>Different tests may be applied to address these questions.
<li>The report should contain a description of tests applied or a reference to software used. 
<li>The report should state whether inconsistencies were corrected or detail the remaining errors.</ol>

<br>
<li><b>Specific Topological Tests</b><ol> 
<li>Logical consistency may be reported as "Topologically Clean" if an automated procedure concludes: <ol>
<li>All chains intersect at nodes (report tolerance used). 
<li>Chains and nodes are consistent around polygons or vice-versa. 
<li>Inner rings embed consistently in enclosing polygons. </ol>
<li>The quality report shall identify the software (name and version) used to verify these conditions.</ol><br>
</ul>
<b>Date of Test</b>
<br>The report should include testing date(s). If corrections/modifications occur after the tests, the report should indicate how the new information was checked for logical consistency. 
</ol>
