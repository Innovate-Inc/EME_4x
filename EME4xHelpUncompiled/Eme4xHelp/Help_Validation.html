<H1>EPA Metadata Editor (EME)</H1>
<H2>Using the EPA Metadata Editor Validator</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EME allows a user to validate records according to <A 
  href="http://epa.gov/geospatial/policies.html" target=blank>EPA's Geospatial 
  Metadata Technical Specification Version 1.0</A>. This validation function 
  tests metadata records for compliancy with both FGDC requirements and 
  EPA requirements. All EPA-compliant records are also FGDC-compliant. This 
  service can be invoked for a single metadata record from the EPA Metadata 
  Editor user interface or it can be invoked in batch-processing mode for a set 
  of files from ArcCatalog. Information on performing validation using both of 
  these methods is provided below. <i>Please Note, if you have problems viewing the 
  validation results in your web browser, please read the information provided 
  at the end of this page.</i> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Validation Configuration Options and Settings</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tab 3 of the EME user interface allows you to specify whether 
  or not to use the EPA's web service for performing metadata validation along 
  with how to view validation results. For more information on configuring the 
  validation settings, please see the 'Validation via Webservice and Viewing 
  Validation Results' section of the <A 
  href="Interface%20Features.html#validate">Interface 
  Features</A> page. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Using the Validation Service for a Single Metadata Record</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After editing your metadata record, you can test the compliancy of 
  your information by going to Tools --> Validate Metadata. <BR>
  <CENTER><IMG src="screenshot_validate_EPA.jpg"></CENTER><BR><BR>Depending on the settings you've 
  configured for viewing the results, you will be presented with the results of 
  validation within a web browser or the EME user interface (shown below). You 
  may choose to view results using either or both of these options. For more 
  information on configuring the validation settings, please see the <A 
  href="Interface%20Features.html#validate">Interface 
  Features</A> page.<BR><BR>The 'View in browser window' option will open a web 
  page and will list the errors and/or warnings found during validation (if any) 
  along with information about the specific line(s) where errors and/or warnings 
  were reported. It also displays the total number of errors and warnings found 
  in the record. You may scroll through the record to view the element(s) that 
  caused the error. Errors will be highlighted in red and warnings will be 
  highlighted in yellow. In cases where the error is described using the term 
  "EPA requires", this error is specific to <A 
  href="http://epa.gov/geospatial/policies.html" target=blank>EPA's Geospatial 
  Metadata Technical Specification Version 1.0</A>. In cases where the error is 
  a standard FGDC error, the "EPA requires" term will not be shown. In cases 
  where a required element is missing, the parent element will be highlighted to 
  so that users can understand which section was missing the required 
  information. <BR><BR>The 'View in EME' option will highlight errors in the 
  user interface using a red balloon. Red balloons are displayed at each 
  location within the EME user interface where errors were found in the metadata 
  record. Users can hover over the balloon to understand what the nature of the 
  error was and then fix the error(s) accordingly (see below).

<H3>Using the Validation Service for a Batch of Metadata Records</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you'd like to validate multiple records simultaneously, you can 
  use the batch validation feature of the EME. This is done in ArcCatalog 
  outside of the EME interface. To batch validate a set of records, take the 
  following steps: <BR><BR>
  <OL>
    <LI>Navigate to a directory or folder of interest in ArcCatalog 
    <LI>Click on the 'Contents' tab. 
    <LI>Select one or more metadata records in the Contents interface 
    <LI>Click on the 'Validate selected records...' button in the Metadata Toolbar in ArcCatalog. Each metadata record selected will be displayed in a separate web page in your browser. The title of the selected record will be displayed in the title of the web page. 
    </LI></OL><BR>

  <H3>Troubleshooting Viewing the Validation Results in your Web Browser</H3>If 
  the EPA Validator results don't appear to be formatted correctly within your 
  web browser, take the following steps:<BR><BR>
  <OL>
    <LI>Open Windows Explorer<BR><BR>
    <LI>In the "Tools" menu, go to "Folder Options"<BR><BR>
    <LI>Click on the "File Types" tab<BR><BR>
    <LI>Pick "XML Document" in the list then click "Edit..."<BR><BR>
    <LI>The "Content Type (MIME)" should be text/xml and "Default Extension for 
    Content Type" should be ".xml"<BR><BR>
    <LI><I>Note: if XML is not in your list, click "New", then enter "xml" for 
    the extension and "XML document" from the drop down list for the file type.
