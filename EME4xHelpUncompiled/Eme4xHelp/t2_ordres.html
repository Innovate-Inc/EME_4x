<blockquote>Element:<b> Ordinate Resolution</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>Type: real</blockquote>
<blockquote>Short Name: ordres</blockquote>
<h3>FGDC Definition</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ordinate Resolution: The (nominal) minimum distance between the "y" or row values of two adjacent points, expressed in Planar Distance Units of measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This element is not required for minimum FGDC compliancy, but becomes required when the "Planar Coordinate Information" element is used.  <em>Note: The Y field in EME corresponds the Ordinate Resolution FGDC element. </em></p>
  <p>These values represent the minimum difference between Y (ordinate)  values in the planar data set. For raster data, the values normally equal pixel size, e.g. 30. For vector data, the values usually indicate the 'fuzzy tolerance' or 'clustering' setting that establishes the minimum distance at which two points will NOT be automatically converged by the data collection device (digitizer, GPS, etc.). NOTE: units of measures are provided under element Planar Distance Units (e.g. meters or milimeters). </p>
</p>
This information is usually captured when one uses the EPA Synchronizer to synchronize the coordinate system information from the data set.  When one uses the EPA Synchronizer, the absres and ordres fields will be automatically populated with the correct information from the dataset.  The EPA Synchronizer is the best way to capture this information, and it is recommended where possible for documenting this element.  One can attempt to do this calculation manually however, using ArcMap or another GIS program. Calculating this information in ArcMap may require a few steps. The ordres value represents the minimum possible difference between coordinate values.  One will need to perform a function that compares all of the points or vertices within the data set and then determine the minimum distance among all of them.  This is best done using a function such as the "near" function (ArcPy) or another spatial processing function. 
<br><br>One may also reference the ESRI help to review the "Resolution" property of a geodatabase feature class.

<br><br>The "Ten Most Common Metadata Errors" document at the FGDC website provides additional information regarding this element.
