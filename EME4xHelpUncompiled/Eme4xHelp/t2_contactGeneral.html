<h1>EPA Metadata Editor (EME)</h1>
<h2>Interface Element Description: Tab 2</h2>
<blockquote>Element:<b> Contacts (Overview)</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>Type: compound CI_ResponsibleParty</blockquote>
<blockquote>ISO Element Name: CI_ResponsibleParty</blockquote>
<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>Provide detailed information in this component to identify the person or organization that should be contacted regarding the resource. Contact information within this element may or may not be the same in each section and can be repeated within each section. Currently, contact information is used with the following elements:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="t2_distcnt.html">Distribution Contact</a></strong> - The party from whom the data set may be obtained.</li>
<li><strong><a href="t2_metaAuthor.html">Metadata Author</a></strong> - The metadata author(s) responsible for the metadata information.</li>
<li><strong><a href="t2_resourceOwner.html">Resource Owner</a></strong> - The owner(s) of the resource</li>
<li><strong><a href="t2_resourceProducer.html">Resource Producer</a></strong> - Those who created/produced the resource</li>
</ul>

These compound elements use an ISO CI_Responsible Party component. The EME Contacts_Info Table stores most of the items required to populate a section.  To pass validation a contact in the Contacts_Info table should contain at the minimum the Contact Name, Organization, and Email. Additionally, for each contact used within a metadata record the user will need to choose a <strong><a href="t2_contactRole.html">Role Code (required)</a></strong> and <strong><a href="t2_contactProgramCode.html">Program Code (if applicable)</a></strong>.

</blockquote>
<h3>Data.gov Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>The EME Contact elements includes 3 mandatory Data.gov elements: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong> - The plaintext name of the entity publishing this resource, corresponding to the FGDC contact organization.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Name</strong> - A contact person's name for the asset, corresponding to the FGDC contact person.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Email</strong> - A valid email address for the contact person listed above. An email address corresponding to a helpdesk or distribution list is an acceptable alternative.</li>
</ul>
If validation fails, the contact info may need to be edited in the <a href="Help_DB.html">EME database</a> or by editing it direclty in the user interface.
