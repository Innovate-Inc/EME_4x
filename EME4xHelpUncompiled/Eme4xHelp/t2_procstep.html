<h3>FGDC Definition</h3>
<blockquote>Information about a single event.</blockquote>
<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>A single process step is required for minimum FGDC compliancy.  Inclusion of additional processing steps that detail information regarding in-house data processing, conversions, and/or transformations is encouraged for preserving data integrity and providing well-documented data lineage.  The procstep element requires the inclusion of a process date and a process description. In the EME, you may add processing steps by clicking on a new row in the interface and entering information about the date and the processing that occurred.</blockquote>
