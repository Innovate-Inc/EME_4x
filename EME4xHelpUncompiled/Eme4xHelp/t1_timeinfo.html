<h1>EPA Metadata Editor (EME)</h1>
<h2>Interface Element Description: Tab 1</h2>
<blockquote>Element:<b> Temporal Extent of Resource </b></blockquote>
<blockquote>Type: compound (single date, range of dates, or indeterminate time periods, and optionally time interval)</blockquote>
<blockquote>ISO Element Name: EX_TemporalExtent </blockquote>

<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This element is required for EPA geospatial assets as per minimum FGDC standards. Users may choose to enter a single date or a range of dates depending on the time period of the data set/resource.  Use the single date option for documenting the time period information when the resource reflects a single date. Use a range of dates for documenting the time period information when the information in your resource reflects a range of dates. Use indeterminate dates to document unknown dates and present dates.  

<br><br>To document the date information using the EME, a user would enter the information using one of the following options: <br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Single Date:</b> Select the Single Date tab and enter a single date using the calendar feature. Or choose an indeterminate date value from the drop down list. The read-only text box will show the to be committed to the metadata record on save.
<li><b>Range of Dates:</b> Select the Time Period Table and use the calendar feature to enter begin and end dates. Or choose an indeterminate date value from the drop down list. Users can optionally specify a <b>Time Interval</b> to represent the frequency between time events based on floating point values. Time Intervals contain an integer entered in the first text box followed by the type of units in the second text box. (e.g., 6  Days)
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>Data.gov Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote><p>  <b>[we need to update this section since they cannot modify dates this way with EME]</b>
    This field should contain an interval of time defined by start and end dates. 
    Dates should be formatted as pairs of {start datetime/end datetime} in the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 
    8601</a> format. ISO 8601 specifies that 
    datetimes can be formatted in a number of ways, including a simple four-digit 
    year (eg. 2013) to a much more specific YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, where the T 
    specifies a seperator between the date and time and time is expressed in 24 hour 
    notation in the UTC (Zulu) time zone. (e.g., 
    2011-02-14T12:00:00Z/2013-07-04T19:34:00Z). Use a solidus ("/") to separate 
    start and end times.</p>
    <p>
        If there is a need to reflect that the dataset is continually updated, ISO 8601 
        formatting can account for this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals">with 
        repeating intervals</a>. For instance, updated monthly starting in January 2010 
        and continuing through the present would be represented as:<code>R/2010-01/P1M</code>.</p>
    <p>
        Updated every 5 minutes beginning on February 15, 2010 would be represented as: <code>R/2010-02-15/PT5M</code>.<br />
        <strong>Example</strong>|<code>{"temporal":"2000-01-15T00:45:00Z/2010-01-15T00:06:00Z"}</code> or <code>{"temporal":"R/2000-01-15T00:45:00Z/P1W"}</code></p>
