<h2>Interface Element Description: Tab 1</h2>
<blockquote>Element:<b> Title</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>Type: text</blockquote>
<blockquote>Short Name: title</blockquote>
<h3>FGDC Definition</h3>
<blockquote>The name by which the data set is known.
</blockquote>
<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote><p>This element is required for EPA geospatial assets as per minimum FGDC standards. Follow FGDC guidance for implementation of this field.</p>
<p>The title should fully describe the resource in a way that distinguishes it from other, similar resources, while also staying as concise as possible. To this end, EPA recommends the following template:<br />
    <code>{SUBJECT, GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT, RELEVANT TIME PERIOD, DATA OWNER/PROVIDER, OFFICE/REGION/RESEARCH LAB OF DATA OWNER}</code><br />
Here is an example of this in practice:<br />
    <code>Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Locations, Oklahoma, 2012, EPA OIAA, EPA REG 06 WQPD</code><br />
    Any individual component of this title template may be omitted if not applicable.  For example, there is no need to include a date if data are frequently or continuously updated.  Or, if the geographic extent is implicit in the subject, i.e. National Hydrography Dataset, it may be omitted provided that the actual extent of the data matches the extent implied in the title (an example of a dataset whose actual extent does not match the implicitly titled extent would be National Hydrography Dataset clipped to a given state).  Geographic Extent should always refer to a place name, not a bounding box or coordinates.</p>

<h3>Data.gov Requirement/Guidance</h3>
