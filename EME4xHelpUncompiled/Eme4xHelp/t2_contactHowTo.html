  <p><strong>To enter a Contact Manually:</strong></p>
  <p>In some cases, the user may want to enter the contact information manually, particularly when only one or two metadata records are being edited. It is recommended, however, that if the user is entering the same  contact information for more than two metadata records, they follow the workflow for entering a contact automatically.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Select the <a href="#role">Role</a> of the contact.</p>
    <p><img src="screenshot_distcnt1.jpg" width="290" height="235" alt=""/></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>To enter a Contact Automatically:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Click on the drop-down arrow in the &quot;Select Contact&quot; box and Select the appropriate name.</p>
    <p><img src="screenshot_distcnt2.jpg" width="108" height="62" alt=""/></p>
    <p>After a name has been selected, several of the Contact Details fields will be automatically populated.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>To add a Distribution Contact to the contact table:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To add an additional contact to the preconfigured contact table, choose Tools &gt; Open Database</p>

    <p>If the &quot;Contact_Information&quot; table is not already displayed, choose &quot;Contact_Information&quot;.</p>
    <p>Click on the Enable Edit Mode button (the table will turn pink when in edit mode)</p>
    <p>Scroll to the bottom of the table and enter the contact information.</p>
    <p><img src="screenshot_distcnt4.jpg" width="1208" height="256" alt=""/><br>
      After adding a new contact, click on the End Edit Mode button (the table will turn back to green) and close the table.</p>
    <p>The newly added contact should now display at the bottom of the list after clicking on the drop-down arrow in the Select Contact box.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>To set the Default contact:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Setting a default contact allows the user to click on the &quot;D&quot; button to autopopulate the fields with the default contact information found in the &quot;Contact_Information&quot; table. </p>
    <p><img src="screenshot_distcnt2.jpg" width="108" height="62" alt=""/></p>
    <p>To open the table, choose Tools &gt; Open Database</p>
    <p><img src="screenshot_openDB2.jpg" width="287" height="102" alt=""/></p>
