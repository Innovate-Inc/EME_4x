<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This field is not required for minimum EPA compliancy, but is made available for users who wish to enter keywords that are not part of the ISO or EPA lists.  <br>
<br><b>Note:</b> User-defined keywords are added to the user interface using the EME database.  They are stored in the "1l_KeywordsUser" table. To enter new keywords, open the "1l_KeywordsUser" table and add the new keywords.  Modifying the thesaurus associated with the new keywords is done using the "EME" table. In the EME table, replace the term 'User' with your thesaurus name in the "idinfo/keywords/theme[themekt='User']/themekt" entry. Also in the EME table, replace the term 'User' with your thesaurus name in the "idinfo/keywords/theme[themekt='User']/themekey" entry.  Any changes performed within the EME table require closing and reopening ArcCatalog for the information to take effect.
