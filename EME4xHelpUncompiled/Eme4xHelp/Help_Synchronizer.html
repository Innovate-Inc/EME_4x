<H2>The EPA Synchronizer</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EPA Synchronizer Manager provides users with the capability to 
  customize how metadata synchronizers work in ArcCatalog. Users can manage 
  which synchronizers to apply to their metadata record and they may also 
  specify which fields to synchronize in the metadata record. This provides 
  users with the ability to synchronize portions of their metadata record with 
  the underlying data set, as opposed to completely enabling or disabling the 
  use of synchronizers. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>What are Synchronizers?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Synchronization is the process by which properties of a data set 
  are read from the data and written into its metadata (e.g., bounding 
  coordinates, spatial reference information, attributes, etc.). ESRI's 
  ArcCatalog uses synchronizers to insert information into your metadata.  
  
  <BR><BR>Synchronizers are considered useful because they remove the 
  burden of documenting some portions of your metadata record by automatically 
  inserting information into your record. They also ensure consistency with the data set, so that changes to the data are applied to the metadata.  They may be considered problematic because 
  they can insert information into your record that is not compliant with FGDC 
  standards. The EPA Synchronizer helps users find a middle ground by providing 
  users with the capability to control which elements are synchronized with the 
  data set. This allows users to retain information for important elements, but 
  also avoids inserting unnecessary information into the 
  metadata record. <BR><BR>Note that the EPA Synchronizer cannot be used to 
  modify synchronization that has already been applied to a record. The 
  synchronization parameters should be set before editing records in ArcCatalog. 
  If you have a metadata record that was already modified by ArcCatalog using 
  the FGDC and/or ISO synchronizers and would like to remove the elements that 
  were inserted into your record by ArcCatalog, please use the "Remove ESRI 
  Elements" button (help for this button is located within the <A href="Interface%20Features.html">'Interface Features' topic</A>). <BR><BR>Also note that the EPA Synchronizer will continue to operate on your metadata record every time the information is 
  viewed in ArcCatalog. This will override any information in your metadata 
  record for the fields you have selected to synchronize (e.g., coordinate 
  system information). If you would like the synchronization process to be 
  discontinued, you will need to disable the ArcCatalog metadata synchronizers 
  by un-checking the creating and updating metadata boxes described below.

<H3>Using the EPA Synchronizer</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EPA Synchronizer is accessed from the EPA metadata 
  toolbar. Clicking the EPA Synchronizer button from the toolbar will open the EPA Synchronizer interface.  Users can select which synchronizers to use and which elements to synchronize.<br><br>

  To use the EPA Synchronizer, take the following steps: </BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL class=disc><B>Set the EPA Synchronizer as the Default Synchronizer</B> 
  <LI>Open the EPA Synchronizer Manager by clicking on the "EPA Synchronizer 
  Manager" button from the Metadata Toolbar 
  <LI>Select the "Select Synchronizers" tab from the EPA Synchronizer Manager 
  interface 
  <LI>Select the EPA Synchronizer and deselect all other available 
  synchronizers<BR><BR>
  </LI></UL>
<UL class=disc><B>Select Which Attributes to Synchronize</B> 
  <LI>Select the "EPA Sync Settings" tab from the EPA Synchronizer Manager 
  interface 
  <LI>Choose which elements to synchronize with your data set 
  <LI>Click 'OK'</LI></UL>

<UL class=disc><B>Apply Synchronization</B> <br>
  <LI>Synchronization can either be <b>applied manually</b> or it may be enabled as a <b>background process</b>.    
  <LI>The background process applies synchronization every time the data set is viewed in the description tab.</li>
  <li>To enable <b>background synchronization</b>, go to Customize-&gt;ArcCatalog Options and select the 'Metadata' tab</LI>
  <LI>Enable the checkbox for 'Automatically update when metadata is viewed.'
  <LI>Select the data set, and view the metadata record in the description tab. This will automatically apply synchronization.<br><br>
  <img src="synch_enable.jpg" border="1"><br><br>
  <LI>To <b>manually synchronize</b> metadata, select the data set in the contents window, and click the <b>'Synchronize Metadata'</b> button in the EPA Metadata Toolbar.  This will force synchronization for your data set and metadata record, using the settings you have specified in the EPA Synchronizer Manager.<br><BR>
