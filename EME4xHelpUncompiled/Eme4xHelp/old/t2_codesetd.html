<blockquote>The codeset domain is used to describe an attribute whose values are defined within an established list. If the attribute being documented has values that are derived from an established set of values (for example, Federal Information Processing Standards that contain numeric codes for nations, States, and counties) then the codeset domain element should be used.  Where possible, the title of the publication containing the code set and the source of the codeset should be provided.
