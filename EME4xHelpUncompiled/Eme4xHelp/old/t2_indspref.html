<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This element is not required for minimum FGDC compliancy. An indirect spatial reference is any way to describe a location without using coordinates. Indirect spatial reference methods usually use a geographic feature, such as a county, state, township or section of the Public Land Survey System, or a road, to uniquely identify a place. The reference may use the name of the feature (for example "Westmoreland County") or a code that identifies the feature (such as a county FIPS code). Other examples of indirect spatial references include street addresses, linear reference systems, and River Reach codes.</p>
