<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This element is not required for minimum FGDC compliancy.  It is recommended that users document attribute information for their data sets where applicable.  This may be done using either the detailed description (this element) or the overview description, or both.  The use of the detailed description or overview sections is dependent on the needs of the individual user. In general, the overview section provides a means for describing attribute information in free text and linking to an online data dictionary, whereas the detailed section provides a means for describing each attribute individually using a standard format that includes the attribute name, description, and domain.</blockquote>
