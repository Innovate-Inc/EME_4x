<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This element is not required for EPA compliancy but is recommended for data sets that contain attribute information.  This element is used to provide an overview of attribute information as opposed to the detailed attribtues section that lists individual attribtues one by one.  Both options may be used together.  This element allows the user to provide a general overview of attribute information and include a link or reference to a published citation or data dictionary.  The overview reference information should be included in the Entity and Attribute Detail Citation field. </blockquote>
