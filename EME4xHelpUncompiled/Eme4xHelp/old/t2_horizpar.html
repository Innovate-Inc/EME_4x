<h3>EPA Requirement/Guidance</h3>
<blockquote>This element is required for minimum EPA compliancy in order to ensure that information regarding data set accuracy is reported. The accuracy report is a qualitative assessment of the accuracy of the data set.  It is recommended that data owners attempt to provide a report, but 'Unknown' is an acceptable entry if accuracy may not be estimated.  <br><br>The defaults provided with the EME are derived from EPA's National Geospatial Data Policy (NGDP).  The NGDP outlines ten 'tiers' of accuracy ranges that are based on data collection method (<a href="http://epa.gov/geospatial/policies.html">http://epa.gov/geospatial/policies.html</a>, Appendix A).  The tiers provide default qualitative assessments of a data set's accuracy for cases when the data set's collection method is known.  If the data set is derived from another source and the collection method is unknown, you may either use the existing accuracy report provided with the data set, or perform an assessment of accuracy if possible. If standard tests were used to evaluate accuracy, please provide information on the standard tests used. </blockquote>
