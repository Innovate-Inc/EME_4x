<H1>EPA Metadata Editor (EME) </H1>
<H2>Introducing the EPA Metadata Editor</H2>
<H3>What is the EPA Metadata Editor?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Metadata Editor 
  (EME) is a desktop application that is intended to simplify and expedite the    process of developing geospatial metadata across the agency. The program is    built as an extension to the Environmental Systems Research Institute's (ESRI)    ArcCatalog and, as of EME version 3.1, <i>also runs as a standalone application</i>. The EME is provided as a customized metadata editing tool that allows users to create metadata that adheres to the EPA's implementation of the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC's) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM). <BR><BR>It is hoped that the use of the    EPA Metadata Editor will result in greater geospatial metadata consistency and compliancy agency-wide in order to provide a solid framework for sharing    assets with others. For more information and additional resources regarding    the EME, please see  <a href="https://edg.epa.gov/EME/">https://edg.epa.gov/EME/</a>. </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <H3>Background</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  
<li>EME version 2.1 was initially released in July 2007. This release was deployed with a number of key features including a configurable database, easily accessible help, an EPA validation service, and a number of interface features designed to help users easily enter information into their records. <br><br>
<li>EME version 3 was released in October 2008, and provided a number of new capabilities, including a configurable EPA Synchronizer that allows users to control synchronization, a configurable path to the EME database, batch validation, ability to remove ESRI tags, and more.  <br><br>
<li>EME version 3.1 was released in April 2011 in order to provide users with an ArcGIS 10-compatible version of the application. This update was required as a result of changes in the  ArcGIS 10 framework that made it incompatible with EME 3.0 and EME 2.1. Additionally, much of the functionality for supporting FGDC CSDGM metadata was removed in ArcGIS version 10.  As such, much of the underlying code base for the EME was updated to be compatible with ArcGIS version 10, and at the same time the application was released as a standalone product.  EME 3.1.1 now provides users with the ability to edit and synchronize FGDC CSDGM metadata within the ArcGIS 10 framework and to run the product as a standalone tool.<br><br>
<li>EME version 3.1.1 was released in July 2011. It provided users with a metadata export tool, keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste, and several other minor enhancements and bug fixes.<br><br>
<li>EME version 3.1.2 was released in September 2011. It provided users with a global find and replace function (single or batch processing) as well as key bug fixes for installing EME and "Refresh from Database" functionality.<br><br>
<li> EME version 3.2 was released in November 2012. It adds support for several fields (Spatial Data Organization Information, Process Step Contact Information, and Source Information) and two projections (Albers Conical Equal Area and Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere). This release also includes minor updates to the EPA stylesheet and the syncrhonization process. It fixes bugs that affected validation and XML export.</BLOCKQUOTE>
