<blockquote>This field is not required for minimum EPA compliancy, but it is recommended so that viewers of your metadata record understand who to contact about the data.  This element provides detailed information about who should be contacted regarding the data set, application, or service specifically (as opposed to the contact for the metadata or the distribution of the data/resource).  
<br><br>
The contact person should be an individual who is knowledgeable about the data, and may be able to answer questions about the data set/resource, as opposed to questions regarding distributing the data and/or the metadata.  Details on how to provide contact information for the distribution of the data and/or regarding the metadata specifically are provided in Tab 3.
